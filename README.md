# Smith Management Game 🛠️🔥

*A cozy blacksmith tycoon where you forge your empire from anvil to legend!*

## 🎮 Overview

**Smith Management** is an addictive idle-management game where you start as a humble apprentice smith and build the ultimate forge empire. Mine ores, craft epic weapons and armor, hire quirky apprentices, fulfill noble orders, and expand your smithy across medieval realms. Balance resources, upgrade your tech tree, and compete in forging contests—or just chill and watch your gold pile up!

Inspired by classics like *Blacksmith Master* and *Magic Forge Tycoon*, but built for quick browser sessions.

## ✨ Features

- **Idle Progression**: AFK gains while your apprentices work—even when tabbed out!
- **Crafting Mini-Games**: Timing-based hammering for that satisfying *clang* feeling.
- **Resource Management**: Mine iron, smelt alloys, enchant with gems—upgrade your supply chain.
- **Hire & Manage Staff**: From clumsy newbies to master enchanters with unique perks.
- **Tech Tree & Expansions**: Unlock steam-powered bellows, dragonfire forges, and guild halls.
- **Dynamic Orders**: Knights, wizards, and kings request custom gear—meet deadlines for bonuses!
- **Endless Mode**: Prestige and restart with permanent buffs for infinite replayability.
- **Local Save**: Progress saved in browser—no accounts needed.

## 📱 How to Play

1. **Open in Browser**: Just double-click `index.html`—no install!
2. **Core Loop**:
   - Click to hammer/craft items manually (for bonuses).
   - Buy upgrades with gold.
   - Assign apprentices to stations (anvil, furnace, polish).
   - Fulfill orders from the quest board.
3. **Prestige**: When maxed, reset for "Legendary Sparks" to boost future runs.

**Pro Tip**: Focus early on bellows upgrades—passive ore mining is OP!
